Academic research about coffee price market on NASDAQ

Abstract: This study explores various machine learning
approaches and feature engineering techniques to optimize the
prediction of stock prices in the market. Multiple models,
including neural networks, decision trees, and others, would be
used to compare based on their predictive performance.
Hyperparameter tuning is going to also be analyzed, and the
models' decisions are going to be justified using performance
metrics and loss visualizations. Additionally, we are going to use
features about temperature, exports (offer and demand) to have
more specific but reliable models. The research aims to identify
the most effective model for accurately forecasting coffee prices in
the dynamic stock market.
